# lsst_ci - A build target for LSST DM Continous Integration

Builds targets key to supported cameras.

Intended for quick (minutes scale) integration testing.

However, it does depend on 10-20 GB of data repositories.  For running on Jenkins or similar build system, this is a one-time cost that should be fine, but it may be annoying to an individual developer who would like to run this package.
